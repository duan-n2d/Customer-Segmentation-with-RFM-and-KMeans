## Introduction
In marketing and any business field related to customer service, understanding and effectively targeting customers is crucial. This project aims to segment customers into different groups based on their behavior and value using the RFM model and machine learning techniques. This segmentation helps businesses to tailor their marketing strategies more effectively.

## Project Overview
This research combines traditional marketing segmentation methods with modern data science techniques. By applying the RFM model and K-means clustering, the project segments customers into distinct groups, providing insights for personalized marketing strategies.
## Research Methods
The project utilizes a combination of quantitative and qualitative research methods:

- Literature Review: Reviewing existing research on customer segmentation and machine learning applications in marketing.
- Data Collection: Using sales and customer data from AdventureWorks Cycles.
- Data Analysis: Applying Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and data preprocessing techniques.
- Model Implementation: Using RFM analysis and K-means clustering for segmentation.
- Evaluation: Assessing the model using metrics such as the Elbow method and Silhouette score.

## Technologies Used
- Programming Language: Python
- Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Tools: Jupyter Notebook

## Installation
To run this project locally, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/customer-segmentation.git
```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
```bash
cd customer-segmentation
```
3. Create a virtual environment:

python3 -m venv venv
```
4. Activate the virtual environment:
On Windows:
``` bash
venv\Scripts\activate
```
On MacOS/Linux:
```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```
5. Install the dependencies:
``` bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
## Usage
1. Prepare the data: Place your dataset in the `data/` directory.
2. Run the Jupyter Notebook:
```bash
jupyter notebook
```
3. Open and run the notebook: Open customer_segmentation.ipynb and run the cells to see the analysis and results.
